# Taskmaster Analysis: Comprehensive Research Framework and Module Guide

## I. Project Overview and Research Philosophy

### A. Advanced Quantitative Analysis Framework

This project represents a comprehensive quantitative exploration of the British comedy panel show Taskmaster, employing sophisticated statistical methods to understand the show's enduring appeal and operational mechanics. The analysis moves beyond simple descriptive statistics to implement:

* **Mixture Model Fitting**: IMDb rating distributions modeled as delta functions (ratings 1 & 10) + Gaussian (ratings 2-9)
* **Goodness of Fit Analysis**: Quantitative model validation with Mean Absolute Error comparisons
* **Principal Component Analysis**: Series-level reception quality profiling
* **Clustering Analysis**: Data-driven contestant archetype identification
* **Sentiment Analysis**: GPT-4o powered extraction of comedic patterns

### B. Data Quality and Validation Standards

* **High Reliability Data**: >99% correlation validation between raw IMDb histograms and official scores
* **Transparent Limitations**: Clear documentation of AI-assisted analysis boundaries
* **Statistical Rigor**: Proper hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and multiple comparison corrections
* **Reproducible Framework**: Clear separation of data processing and visualization

### C. Configuration and Consistency (`config/plot_config.yaml`)

```yaml
# Global settings for publication-quality outputs
global:
  dpi: 300
  figure_size: [12, 8]
