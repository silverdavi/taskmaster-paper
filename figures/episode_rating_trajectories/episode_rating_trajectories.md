# Episode Rating Trajectories Analysis

## Overview

This figure visualizes how episode ratings evolve within each series of Taskmaster, revealing consistent patterns in viewer engagement. The analysis shows that 16 out of 18 series (89%) follow one of two key patterns:

1. **Rising Pattern (8 series)**: Ratings consistently increase from start to finish
2. **J-Shaped Pattern (8 series)**: Ratings dip in the middle before rising to a strong finish

## Key Results

### Statistical Significance
- **Key patterns prevalence**: 89% of series (16/18) follow rising or J-shaped patterns
- **Binomial test p-value**: 1.68 × 10⁻⁶ (highly significant)
- **Chi-square test**: χ² = 10.89, p = 0.012 (pattern distribution is non-random)

### Rating Changes
- **First to last episode**: +0.28 mean difference (p < 0.001)
- **First to middle**: +0.01 mean difference (p = 0.89, not significant)
- **Middle to last**: +0.28 mean difference (p < 0.001)

### Notable Findings

1. **Series 5 shows the largest improvement**: From 7.9 to 8.8 (+0.9 points)
2. **Only 2 series (1 and 2) show declining patterns**: Both early series from 2015
3. **Average rating improvement**: 0.28 points from first to last episode
4. **J-shaped patterns show larger middle dips**: Average -0.21 in the middle
5. **Rising patterns show steady growth**: Continuous improvement throughout

## Implementation Details

### Data Processing (`process_episode_trajectories_data.py`)

The script:
1. Loads episode ratings from `imdb_ratings.csv`
2. Filters UK series (18 series, excluding NZ/US versions)
3. Normalizes ratings relative to series mean
4. Categorizes episodes into three positions:
   - First: Episode 1
   - Middle: Episodes 2 through n-1
   - Last: Final episode
5. Assigns patterns based on relative positions (1=lowest, 2=middle, 3=highest)
6. Identifies key patterns (123=Rising, 213=J-Shaped)
7. Performs statistical tests on pattern significance

### Plotting (`plot_episode_trajectories.py`)

Creates a 6×3 grid of subplots showing:
- Raw IMDb ratings (black line) with episode numbers
- Three-position summary (colored bars):
  - First episode (red)
  - Middle episodes (blue) 
  - Last episode (green)
- Pattern classification labels
- Clean, minimalist design with no redundant elements

## Output Files

- `episode_patterns.csv`: Episode-level data with patterns
- `series_patterns.csv`: Series-level summaries
- `pattern_statistics.csv`: Statistical test results
- `figure2_output.pdf/png`: Final figure

## Insights for Paper

1. **Viewer engagement increases over a series**: The consistent pattern of rising ratings suggests viewers become more invested as they become familiar with contestants and running jokes develop.

2. **Middle episode slump is real**: J-shaped patterns in 44% of series suggest a common trajectory where middle episodes lag before strong finales.

3. **Pattern has shifted over time**: Early series (1-2) showed declining patterns, while all recent series show rising or J-shaped patterns, suggesting the show has learned to build momentum.

4. **Statistical robustness**: Multiple tests confirm these patterns are not due to chance (p < 0.001 for key comparisons).

5. **Practical implications**: The analysis suggests that Taskmaster's format naturally builds viewer engagement within each series, with finales being particularly well-received.
