Figure 1: Series-Level IMDb Ratings. (A) Ridge plot showing IMDb rating distributions for all series, with Gaussian fits for ratings 2-9 and delta bars for Rating 1 (red) and Rating 10 (green). Series 7 has the highest mean rating (μ={highest_mu:.2f}), while Series 10 has the lowest (μ={lowest_mu:.2f}). The height of the bars represents the percentage of extreme ratings given to each series. (B) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of series reception profiles based on four key metrics: percentage of Rating 1, percentage of Rating 10, mean rating (μ), and standard deviation (σ). The first two principal components explain {total_explained_var:.1%} of the variance. Points are colored by mean rating, with greener points representing higher-rated series. Blue arrows show the influence of each feature on the principal components.
