# Figure 1: Series-Level IMDb Ratings

## Overview

Figure 1 consists of two panels that visualize the IMDb ratings across all Taskmaster series:

1. **Panel A: Ridge plot** showing the distribution of ratings for each series, decomposed into:
   - A Gaussian fit for ratings 2-9
   - Delta markers for extreme ratings (1s and 10s)

2. **Panel B: PCA plot** showing how series relate to each other based on their rating profiles:
   - PC1 and PC2 derived from four key metrics: percentage of 1s, percentage of 10s, mean of ratings 2-9, standard deviation of ratings 2-9
   - Loading vectors showing the influence of each feature
   - Color-coding based on mean rating quality

## Implementation Details

### Data Processing (`process_data_figure1.py`)

The data processing script:

1. Loads IMDb rating data from `taskmaster_histograms_corrected.csv`
2. For each series:
   - Fits a Gaussian distribution to ratings 2-9
   - Calculates percentage of 1-star and 10-star ratings
   - Computes mean and standard deviation for the Gaussian
   - Records episode count and total votes
   - Calculates overall mean rating
3. Performs PCA on these four metrics:
   - Percentage of 1-star ratings (`pct_1s`)
   - Percentage of 10-star ratings (`pct_10s`)
   - Mean of ratings 2-9 (`mu`)
   - Standard deviation of ratings 2-9 (`sigma`)
4. Calculates additional statistics for the figure caption:
   - Series with highest/lowest mean ratings
   - Series with most extreme ratings (1s and 10s)
   - Correlations between mean rating and extreme ratings
   - Distribution of series across PCA quadrants
5. Saves processed data directly to the figure1 folder:
   - `series_metrics.csv` - Series-level metrics
   - `series_pca.csv` - PCA coordinates
   - `pca_loadings.csv` - Feature loadings
   - `explained_variance.npy` - Explained variance ratios
   - `metrics.json` - Metrics for caption

### Plotting (`plot_figure1.py`)

The plotting script creates:

#### Panel A: Ridge Plot

This panel shows:

- One ridge per series, ordered by series number
- Gaussian curves fitted to ratings 2-9, showing the "central tendency" of ratings
- Red markers at rating 1 showing percentage of 1-star ratings (size proportional to percentage)
- Green markers at rating 10 showing percentage of 10-star ratings (size proportional to percentage)
- Series labels with mean rating (Î¼) annotated
- Reference line at rating 7 (common threshold for "good" ratings)
- Legend explaining the components

Improvements from the reference script (`plot_seaborn_ridgeline_decomposed.py`):
- Marker size scales with percentage of extreme ratings
- Text annotations showing percentage values for significant extremes
- White outlines around text for better readability
- Integration with central styling configuration
- More informative labeling with mean ratings

#### Panel B: PCA Plot

This panel shows:

- Each series as a point in 2D space determined by PCA
- Series numbers as labels with white outlines for visibility
- Color gradient from red (low mean) to green (high mean)
- Loading vectors (blue arrows) showing the influence of each feature
- Feature labels with intelligent positioning based on vector direction
- Legend explaining point colors and loading vectors
- Annotation showing total explained variance
- Grid and axis lines for better readability

Improvements from the reference script (`plot_pca_analysis.py`):
- More focused visualization with clearer feature vectors
- Better labeling of features with descriptive names in boxes
- Intelligent text positioning based on vector direction
- Integration with central styling configuration
- Concise legend explaining the components

## Code Structure

The implementation follows a strict separation of concerns:

1. `process_data_figure1.py`:
   - Handles ALL data processing and transformation
   - Performs statistical analysis and dimension reduction
   - Saves processed data and metrics directly to the figure1 folder
   - Contains the "business logic" of the figure

2. `plot_figure1.py`:
   - Handles ONLY visualization
   - Takes processed data as input (assumes processing is complete)
   - Loads data directly from the figure1 folder
   - Creates visualizations with consistent styling
   - Generates caption based on metrics
   - Contains NO data processing logic

## Output Files

The implementation produces the following files in the figure1 directory:

- **Processed Data**:
  - `series_metrics.csv` - Series-level metrics
  - `series_pca.csv` - PCA coordinates
  - `pca_loadings.csv` - Feature loadings
  - `explained_variance.npy` - Explained variance ratios

- **Figure Output**:
  - `figure1_output.pdf` - The final figure
  - `metrics.json` - Key metrics used in the caption
  - `caption.txt` - Generated caption for the paper

## Expected Insights

This figure should reveal:

- Which series have the highest/lowest mean ratings
- How the distribution of ratings varies across series
- Which series have the most polarizing ratings (high percentages of 1s and 10s)
- How series cluster based on their rating profiles
- Whether later series show different rating patterns than earlier ones
- The relationship between mean ratings and extreme ratings

The PCA plot in particular helps identify which aspects of the rating distribution (mean, variance, extremes) contribute most to differences between series.
