Figure 6: The Geometry of Taskmaster Scoring Patterns

This scatter plot reveals the mathematical structure underlying Taskmaster's 5-contestant scoring system. Each point represents a possible way to distribute scores (0-5) among contestants, positioned by mean score (x-axis) and variance (y-axis), with color indicating skew. Black circles show patterns actually used in the show, sized by frequency.

The visualization demonstrates that despite 252 theoretically possible scoring patterns, the show uses only 98 (38.9%) in practice. The most common pattern is the perfect spread {1,2,3,4,5} (353 instances), reflecting the show's preference for clear ranking differentiation. 

Key patterns include:
- {1,2,3,4,5}: Perfect ranking spread (353 times, mean=3.00)
- {0,2,3,4,5}: One failure, others ranked (35 times, mean=2.80) 
- {0,0,0,0,5}: Dramatic failure/success split (22 times, mean=1.00)
- {2,2,3,4,5}: Tied low scores (27 times, mean=3.20)

The geometric constraints reveal the show's implicit scoring philosophy: favoring patterns with moderate variance that preserve contestant ranking while avoiding extreme skew. Points without black circles represent valid distributions never used, highlighting the systematic nature of Taskmaster's scoring decisions.

Color scale: Red indicates positive skew (more low scores), blue indicates negative skew (more high scores), white represents symmetric distributions. Circle size is proportional to frequency of use in the dataset.
