Figure 7b: Distribution of All Sentiment Metrics Across Episodes

This figure displays violin plots showing the full distribution of all seven sentiment metrics across 149 Taskmaster episodes, providing context for the overall emotional landscape of the show. Each violin plot reveals the probability density and range of sentiment values, with the median (white line) and mean (white dot) clearly marked.

**Awkwardness** (highlighted in red) shows the significant temporal trend identified in Figure 7a, while the remaining six sentiment metrics (anger, frustration/despair, humor, joy/excitement, sarcasm, self-deprecation) remain stable over time and are shown in gray.

The violin plots reveal:
- **Humor** shows the highest overall levels and widest distribution
- **Anger** shows the lowest levels with a narrow distribution  
- **Awkwardness** has moderate levels but shows the significant increasing trend over time
- Most sentiments show relatively normal distributions with some skewness

Methodology:
- **Data source**: All 149 episodes across 18 series
- **Sentiment metrics**: Seven emotional dimensions measured per episode
- **FDR correction**: Statistical testing at 1% false discovery rate
- **Highlighting**: Red indicates the metric with significant temporal trend

Key Insight:
While most emotional aspects of Taskmaster remain stable across its evolution (as shown by the gray distributions), only awkwardness demonstrates systematic change over time, making it unique among the show's emotional characteristics.
