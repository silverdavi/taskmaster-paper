Figure 7: Sentiment Evolution in Taskmaster Episodes

This figure presents a comprehensive analysis of emotional sentiment across 18 series of Taskmaster, using weighted linear regression and False Discovery Rate correction.

**Left panel**: Shows the single statistically significant trend identified across seven sentiment metrics (anger, awkwardness, frustration/despair, humor, joy/excitement, sarcasm, self-deprecation): **Awkwardness increasing** over time (slope = 0.012 units/series, p = 0.0027, RÂ² = 0.576). Individual series averages are shown as points, with the trend line and 95% confidence interval shaded. 

**Right panel**: Violin plots display the full distribution of all sentiment metrics across all 149 episodes, providing context for the overall emotional landscape of the show. Awkwardness (highlighted in red) shows the significant temporal trend, while other sentiments remain stable over time.

Methodology:
- **Sentiment focus**: Analysis restricted to emotional/sentiment metrics only
- **Weighted regression**: Series-level means weighted by inverse standard errors
- **FDR correction**: Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controls false discovery rate at 1% across 7 sentiment metrics
- **Coverage**: 149 episodes across 18 series, spanning the show's complete run

Key Finding:
Of all emotional dimensions measured, only awkwardness shows a significant linear increase over time. This suggests that while most aspects of the show's emotional character have remained stable (as shown in the violin plots), there has been a systematic evolution toward more cringe-inducing, uncomfortable moments - perhaps reflecting changes in contestant selection, task design, or comedic emphasis as the show matured.
