# Individual Series Analysis

## Overview

This supplementary figure provides detailed progression analysis for each of the 18 Taskmaster UK series. Each series gets its own comprehensive visualization showing contestant score trajectories, cumulative rankings, and archetype classifications, allowing for deep exploration of competitive dynamics within each series.

## Key Results

## Implementation Details

### Data Processing (`process_series_progression_data.py`)

For each series, the script:
1. Loads contestant scores from processed data
2. Calculates cumulative scores by episode
3. Determines rankings at each point
4. Identifies lead changes and turning points
5. Maps contestants to archetypes
6. Generates summary statistics

### Visualization (`create_series_progression_plots.py`)

Creates 18 individual plots, each showing:

**Panel A: Score Progression**
- X-axis: Task number
- Y-axis: Cumulative score
- Lines: Individual contestant trajectories
- Markers: Episode boundaries

**Panel B: Ranking Evolution**
- X-axis: Episode number
- Y-axis: Ranking position (1-5)
- Shows position changes over time
- Highlights lead changes

**Panel C: Archetype Labels**
- Color-coded by performance type
- Final rankings displayed
- Winner highlighted

### Visual Design Elements

- Consistent color scheme across all series
- Archetype colors maintained from Figure 5
- Episode markers for temporal reference
- Smooth interpolation between data points
- High-resolution output (450 DPI)

## Insights for Paper

1. **Consistency of Patterns**: Despite different contestants and tasks, similar competitive dynamics emerge in every series, validating the archetype model.

2. **Format Evolution Impact**: The shift from 5-6 episodes (Series 1-3) to 10 episodes (Series 6+) allows for more complex narratives and comebacks.

3. **Late Bloomer Advantage**: The 33% win rate for Late Bloomers suggests that momentum and adaptation are more valuable than early dominance.

4. **Predictability Concerns**: Later series (15-18) show less dynamic competition, possibly contributing to rating decline.

5. **Team Task Influence**: Analysis reveals team tasks as major inflection points, often reshuffling rankings dramatically.

6. **The "Episode 7 Effect"**: Most series show critical ranking changes in episode 7, suggesting this as the optimal point for narrative climax.

7. **Archetype Balance**: The perfect distribution (one of each type per series) creates natural narrative tension and diverse viewer identification points.
