Figure 7a: Significant Sentiment Trend - Awkwardness Increasing Over Time

This figure shows the single statistically significant trend identified across seven sentiment metrics in Taskmaster episodes. **Awkwardness increasing** over time (slope = 0.012 units/series, p = 0.0027, R² = 0.576) represents the only sentiment dimension that shows systematic change across the show's 18-series evolution.

Individual series averages are shown as red points, with the linear trend line and 95% confidence interval shaded in red. The strong positive correlation (R² = 0.576) indicates that 57.6% of the variation in awkwardness levels can be explained by the series number, demonstrating a robust temporal trend.

Methodology:
- **Weighted regression**: Series-level means weighted by inverse standard errors
- **FDR correction**: Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controls false discovery rate at 1% across 7 sentiment metrics
- **Coverage**: 149 episodes across 18 series

Key Finding:
Taskmaster episodes have systematically become more cringe-inducing and uncomfortable over time, suggesting evolution in contestant selection, task design, or comedic emphasis as the show matured. This is the only emotional dimension showing significant temporal change among all measured sentiment metrics.
