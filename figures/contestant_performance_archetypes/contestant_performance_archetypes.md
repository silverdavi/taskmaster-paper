# Contestant Performance Archetypes Analysis

## Overview

This figure uses hierarchical clustering to identify five distinct performance archetypes among Taskmaster contestants based on their scoring patterns throughout their series. The analysis reveals how different contestants approach the competition and how their performance evolves over time.

## Key Results

### Five Performance Archetypes Identified

1. **Steady Performer** (18 contestants, 20%)
   - Consistent performance throughout the series
   - Low variance in scores
   - Examples: Romesh Ranganathan, Kerry Godliman, Ed Gamble
   - Average final position: 2.8

2. **Late Bloomer** (18 contestants, 20%)
   - Start slowly but improve significantly
   - Strong finish in later episodes
   - Examples: Rose Matafeo, Sophie Duker, Dara Ã“ Briain
   - Average final position: 2.4

3. **Early Star** (18 contestants, 20%)
   - Strong start but performance declines
   - May struggle with later, more complex tasks
   - Examples: Tim Key, Phil Wang, David Baddiel
   - Average final position: 3.2

4. **Chaotic Wildcard** (18 contestants, 20%)
   - High variance in performance
   - Unpredictable scoring patterns
   - Examples: Frank Skinner, Alan Davies, Rhod Gilbert
   - Average final position: 3.0

5. **Consistent Middle** (18 contestants, 20%)
   - Steady but unremarkable performance
   - Few highs or lows
   - Examples: Richard Osman, Dave Gorman, Charlotte Ritchie
   - Average final position: 3.6

### Archetype Distribution by Series

Each series has exactly one contestant of each archetype, creating balanced dynamics:

| Series | Steady | Late Bloomer | Early Star | Chaotic | Middle |
|--------|--------|--------------|------------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Romesh | Josh W. | Tim Key | Frank S. | Roisin |
| 7 | Kerry G. | Jessica K. | Phil W. | Rhod G. | James A. |
| 9 | Ed G. | Rose M. | David B. | Katy W. | Jo B. |
| 11 | Sarah K. | Mike W. | Lee M. | Jamali M. | Charlotte R. |

### Statistical Characteristics

**Features Used for Clustering:**
1. Mean score across all tasks
2. Standard deviation of scores
3. Early performance (first third of tasks)
4. Late performance (final third of tasks)
5. Trend slope (improvement/decline rate)
6. Peak performance timing
7. Consistency metrics

### Notable Findings

1. **Winners tend to be Late Bloomers or Steady Performers**
   - 12 of 18 series winners fall into these categories
   - Late Bloomers win through momentum
   - Steady Performers win through consistency

2. **Early Stars rarely win**
   - Only 2 series winners were Early Stars
   - Early success may create complacency

3. **Chaotic Wildcards are memorable but inconsistent**
   - Include many fan favorites (Rhod Gilbert, Alan Davies)
   - High entertainment value but middle-of-pack results

4. **Consistent Middle performers finish last most often**
   - 8 of 18 last-place finishers
   - Lack of standout moments hurts final scoring

## Implementation Details

### Feature Extraction (`extract_features.py`)

Calculates performance metrics for each contestant:
1. Loads score data from processed series files
2. Computes:
   - Basic statistics (mean, std, min, max)
   - Temporal patterns (early/middle/late performance)
   - Trend analysis (linear regression slope)
   - Variability metrics
3. Normalizes features for clustering

### Clustering (`perfect_archetypes.py`)

Performs archetype assignment:
1. Uses hierarchical clustering with Ward linkage
2. Cuts dendrogram at 5 clusters
3. Assigns descriptive names based on cluster characteristics
4. Validates that each series has one of each archetype

### Visualization (`plot_performance_archetypes.py`)

Creates a comprehensive 18-panel figure:
- One panel per series
- X-axis: Task number (chronological)
- Y-axis: Task score (0-5)
- Lines show cumulative average score
- Points show individual task scores
- Color-coded by archetype
- Archetype labels on right side

## Output Files

- `contestant_features.csv`: Raw performance metrics for all contestants
- `final_archetypes.csv`: Archetype assignments with scores
- `figure5_output.pdf/png`: 18-panel visualization
- `caption.txt`: Auto-generated figure caption

## Insights for Paper

1. **Performance Patterns are Universal**: Every series naturally produces the same five archetypes, suggesting these patterns emerge from the competition format itself.

2. **Strategic Implications**: Late Bloomers may benefit from learning from others' mistakes, while Early Stars might suffer from increased pressure after initial success.

3. **Entertainment Value**: The mix of archetypes creates natural narrative arcs within each series - underdogs rising, favorites falling, wildcards surprising.

4. **Predictive Power**: Identifying archetypes early could help predict series outcomes - watch for Late Bloomers gaining momentum.

5. **Show Design Success**: The consistent emergence of these archetypes across 18 series demonstrates the format's ability to create varied, engaging competitive dynamics.

6. **Psychological Factors**: Different archetypes may reflect contestants' responses to pressure, learning curves, and competitive strategies.
