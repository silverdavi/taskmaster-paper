## Key Analysis Results

### Episode-Level ML Performance (Figure 8a)
| Model | Average CV R² | Average Test R² | Best Test R² |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Linear Regression | 0.120 | 0.134 | 0.166 |
| Ridge Regression | 0.120 | 0.134 | 0.166 |
| Random Forest | 0.368 | 0.375 | 0.385 |

### Series-Level Correlations (Figure 8b)
- **Total Features Analyzed**: 35 (from 48 columns, excluding histograms and constants)
- **Correlation Range**: -0.660 to +0.443
- **Mean Correlation**: -0.105
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.321

#### Top 10 Strongest Correlations:
1. **series_squared**: -0.660 (p=0.003) 
2. **contestant_gender_diversity**: -0.629 (p=0.005)   
3. **contestant_prop_actors**: -0.621 (p=0.006) 
4. **series_order**: -0.597 (p=0.009) 
5. **avg_self_deprecation_std**: -0.541 (p=0.020) 
6. **is_recent_series**: -0.500 (p=0.034) 
7. **avg_sarcasm_std**: -0.491 (p=0.039) 
8. **is_early_series**: +0.443 (p=0.066) TREND:
9. **contestant_avg_age**: +0.435 (p=0.071) TREND:
10. **num_episodes**: -0.431 (p=0.074) 

### Random Forest Feature Importance & Strategy

#### Features to MAXIMIZE (TREND:):
1. **Contestant Average Age** (39.5% importance, +0.396 correlation)
   - Target: >41.4 years (75th percentile)
   - Strategy: Cast older, more experienced performers

2. **Contestant Average Experience** (16.2% importance, +0.019 correlation)  
   - Target: >26.0 years experience (75th percentile)
   - Strategy: Prioritize TV veterans

3. **Contestant Proportion Comedians** (6.5% importance, +0.331 correlation)
   - Strategy: Include professional comedians in lineup

4. **Contestant Proportion Female** (5.2% importance, +0.108 correlation)
   - Strategy: Balanced or female-majority lineups

#### Features to MINIMIZE ():
1. **Average Awkwardness** (32.6% importance, -0.151 correlation)
   - Target: <2.39 (25th percentile)  
   - Strategy: Avoid awkward moments, maintain smooth flow

## Strategic Insights

###  Golden Formula for High IMDB Scores:
**Cast older (40+), experienced comedians with polished TV personas and minimal awkwardness.**

### TREND: Professional Polish vs Amateur Charm:
The analysis reveals that professional polish significantly outperforms amateur charm:
- Older contestants (41+ years) perform better
- Professional comedians add value
- TV experience correlates with success
- Minimizing awkwardness is crucial

###  Production Recommendations:
1. **Casting Priority**: Target experienced performers aged 40+
2. **Comedy Focus**: Include professional comedians in each series
3. **Gender Balance**: Aim for balanced or female-majority lineups  
4. **Flow Management**: Edit to minimize awkward moments
5. **Experience Matters**: Prioritize contestants with 25+ years in entertainment

## Technical Notes
