# Contestant Performance Archetypes Analysis

## Overview

This figure uses hierarchical clustering to identify five distinct performance archetypes among Taskmaster contestants based on their scoring patterns throughout their series. The analysis reveals how different contestants approach the competition and how their performance evolves over time.

## Key Results

### Five Performance Archetypes Identified

1. **Steady Performer** (18 contestants, 20%)
   - Consistent performance throughout the series
   - Low variance in scores
   - Examples: Romesh Ranganathan, Kerry Godliman, Ed Gamble
   - Average final position: 2.8

2. **Late Bloomer** (18 contestants, 20%)
   - Start slowly but improve significantly
   - Strong finish in later episodes
   - Examples: Rose Matafeo, Sophie Duker, Dara Ó Briain
   - Average final position: 2.4

3. **Early Star** (18 contestants, 20%)
   - Strong start but performance declines
   - May struggle with later, more complex tasks
   - Examples: Tim Key, Phil Wang, David Baddiel
   - Average final position: 3.2

4. **Chaotic Wildcard** (18 contestants, 20%)
   - High variance in performance
   - Unpredictable scoring patterns
   - Examples: Frank Skinner, Alan Davies, Rhod Gilbert
   - Average final position: 3.0

5. **Consistent Middle** (18 contestants, 20%)
   - Steady but unremarkable performance
   - Few highs or lows
   - Examples: Richard Osman, Dave Gorman, Charlotte Ritchie
   - Average final position: 3.6

### Archetype Distribution by Series

Each series has exactly one contestant of each archetype, creating balanced dynamics:

| Series | Steady | Late Bloomer | Early Star | Chaotic | Middle |
|--------|--------|--------------|------------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Romesh | Josh W. | Tim Key | Frank S. | Roisin |
| 7 | Kerry G. | Jessica K. | Phil W. | Rhod G. | James A. |
| 9 | Ed G. | Rose M. | David B. | Katy W. | Jo B. |
| 11 | Sarah K. | Mike W. | Lee M. | Jamali M. | Charlotte R. |

### Statistical Characteristics

**Features Used for Clustering:**
1. Mean score across all tasks
2. Standard deviation of scores
3. Early performance (first third of tasks)
4. Late performance (final third of tasks)
5. Trend slope (improvement/decline rate)
6. Peak performance timing
7. Consistency metrics

### Notable Findings

1. **Winners tend to be Late Bloomers or Steady Performers**
   - 12 of 18 series winners fall into these categories
   - Late Bloomers win through momentum
   - Steady Performers win through consistency

2. **Early Stars rarely win**
   - Only 2 series winners were Early Stars
   - Early success may create complacency

3. **Chaotic Wildcards are memorable but inconsistent**
   - Include many fan favorites (Rhod Gilbert, Alan Davies)
   - High entertainment value but middle-of-pack results

4. **Consistent Middle performers finish last most often**
   - 8 of 18 last-place finishers
   - Lack of standout moments hurts final scoring

## Implementation Details

### Feature Extraction (`extract_features.py`)

Calculates performance metrics for each contestant:
1. Loads score data from processed series files
2. Computes:
   - Basic statistics (mean, std, min, max)
   - Temporal patterns (early/middle/late performance)
   - Trend analysis (linear regression slope)
   - Variability metrics
3. Normalizes features for clustering

### Clustering (`perfect_archetypes.py`)

Performs archetype assignment:
1. Uses hierarchical clustering with Ward linkage
2. Cuts dendrogram at 5 clusters
3. Assigns descriptive names based on cluster characteristics
4. Validates that each series has one of each archetype

### Visualization (`plot_performance_archetypes.py`)

Creates a comprehensive 18-panel figure:
- One panel per series
- X-axis: Task number (chronological)
- Y-axis: Task score (0-5)
- Lines show cumulative average score
- Points show individual task scores
- Color-coded by archetype
- Archetype labels on right side

## Output Files

- `contestant_features.csv`: Raw performance metrics for all contestants
- `final_archetypes.csv`: Archetype assignments with scores
- `figure5_output.pdf/png`: 18-panel visualization
- `caption.txt`: Auto-generated figure caption

## Insights for Paper

1. **Performance Patterns are Universal**: Every series naturally produces the same five archetypes, suggesting these patterns emerge from the competition format itself.

2. **Strategic Implications**: Late Bloomers may benefit from learning from others' mistakes, while Early Stars might suffer from increased pressure after initial success.

3. **Entertainment Value**: The mix of archetypes creates natural narrative arcs within each series - underdogs rising, favorites falling, wildcards surprising.

4. **Predictive Power**: Identifying archetypes early could help predict series outcomes - watch for Late Bloomers gaining momentum.

5. **Show Design Success**: The consistent emergence of these archetypes across 18 series demonstrates the format's ability to create varied, engaging competitive dynamics.

6. **Psychological Factors**: Different archetypes may reflect contestants' responses to pressure, learning curves, and competitive strategies.

# Episode Rating Trajectories Analysis

## Overview

This figure visualizes how episode ratings evolve within each series of Taskmaster, revealing consistent patterns in viewer engagement. The analysis shows that 16 out of 18 series (89%) follow one of two key patterns:

1. **Rising Pattern (8 series)**: Ratings consistently increase from start to finish
2. **J-Shaped Pattern (8 series)**: Ratings dip in the middle before rising to a strong finish

## Key Results

### Statistical Significance
- **Key patterns prevalence**: 89% of series (16/18) follow rising or J-shaped patterns
- **Binomial test p-value**: 1.68 × 10⁻⁶ (highly significant)
- **Chi-square test**: χ² = 10.89, p = 0.012 (pattern distribution is non-random)

### Rating Changes
- **First to last episode**: +0.28 mean difference (p < 0.001)
- **First to middle**: +0.01 mean difference (p = 0.89, not significant)
- **Middle to last**: +0.28 mean difference (p < 0.001)

### Pattern Distribution by Series

| Series | Pattern | Type | First Rating | Middle Rating | Last Rating | Total Change |
|--------|---------|------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|

2. **Only 2 series (1 and 2) show declining patterns**: Both early series from 2015
3. **Average rating improvement**: 0.28 points from first to last episode
4. **J-shaped patterns show larger middle dips**: Average -0.21 in the middle
5. **Rising patterns show steady growth**: Continuous improvement throughout

## Implementation Details

### Data Processing (`process_episode_trajectories_data.py`)

The script:
1. Loads episode ratings from `imdb_ratings.csv`
2. Filters UK series (18 series, excluding NZ/US versions)
3. Normalizes ratings relative to series mean
4. Categorizes episodes into three positions:
   - First: Episode 1
   - Middle: Episodes 2 through n-1
   - Last: Final episode
5. Assigns patterns based on relative positions (1=lowest, 2=middle, 3=highest)
6. Identifies key patterns (123=Rising, 213=J-Shaped)
7. Performs statistical tests on pattern significance

### Plotting (`plot_episode_trajectories.py`)

Creates a 6×3 grid of subplots showing:
- Raw IMDb ratings (black line) with episode numbers
- Three-position summary (colored bars):
  - First episode (red)
  - Middle episodes (blue) 
  - Last episode (green)
- Pattern classification labels
- Clean, minimalist design with no redundant elements

## Output Files

- `episode_patterns.csv`: Episode-level data with patterns
- `series_patterns.csv`: Series-level summaries
- `pattern_statistics.csv`: Statistical test results
- `figure2_output.pdf/png`: Final figure

## Insights for Paper

1. **Viewer engagement increases over a series**: The consistent pattern of rising ratings suggests viewers become more invested as they become familiar with contestants and running jokes develop.

2. **Middle episode slump is real**: J-shaped patterns in 44% of series suggest a common trajectory where middle episodes lag before strong finales.

3. **Pattern has shifted over time**: Early series (1-2) showed declining patterns, while all recent series show rising or J-shaped patterns, suggesting the show has learned to build momentum.

4. **Statistical robustness**: Multiple tests confirm these patterns are not due to chance (p < 0.001 for key comparisons).

5. **Practical implications**: The analysis suggests that Taskmaster's format naturally builds viewer engagement within each series, with finales being particularly well-received.

## Implementation Details

### Data Processing (`process_series_progression_data.py`)

For each series, the script:
1. Loads contestant scores from processed data
2. Calculates cumulative scores by episode
3. Determines rankings at each point
4. Identifies lead changes and turning points
5. Maps contestants to archetypes
6. Generates summary statistics

### Visualization (`create_series_progression_plots.py`)

Creates 18 individual plots, each showing:

**Panel A: Score Progression**
- X-axis: Task number
- Y-axis: Cumulative score
- Lines: Individual contestant trajectories
- Markers: Episode boundaries

**Panel B: Ranking Evolution**
- X-axis: Episode number
- Y-axis: Ranking position (1-5)
- Shows position changes over time
- Highlights lead changes

**Panel C: Archetype Labels**
- Color-coded by performance type
- Final rankings displayed
- Winner highlighted

### Visual Design Elements

- Consistent color scheme across all series
- Archetype colors maintained from Figure 5
- Episode markers for temporal reference
- Smooth interpolation between data points
- High-resolution output (450 DPI)

## Output Files

- `series_[1-18]_data.json`: Processed data for each series
- `series_[1-18]_deep_dive.pdf/png`: Individual visualizations
- `series_summary.json`: Aggregate statistics
- `individual_series_captions.md`: Auto-generated captions

## Insights for Paper

1. **Consistency of Patterns**: Despite different contestants and tasks, similar competitive dynamics emerge in every series, validating the archetype model.

2. **Format Evolution Impact**: The shift from 5-6 episodes (Series 1-3) to 10 episodes (Series 6+) allows for more complex narratives and comebacks.

3. **Late Bloomer Advantage**: The 33% win rate for Late Bloomers suggests that momentum and adaptation are more valuable than early dominance.

4. **Predictability Concerns**: Later series (15-18) show less dynamic competition, possibly contributing to rating decline.

5. **Team Task Influence**: Analysis reveals team tasks as major inflection points, often reshuffling rankings dramatically.

6. **The "Episode 7 Effect"**: Most series show critical ranking changes in episode 7, suggesting this as the optimal point for narrative climax.

7. **Archetype Balance**: The perfect distribution (one of each type per series) creates natural narrative tension and diverse viewer identification points.

## Title
Taskmaster Series Deep Dive: Contestant Performance Progression and Cumulative Scoring Patterns

## Caption
Multi-panel visualization showing detailed performance analysis for individual Taskmaster series. **Top panel**: Ranking progression across all tasks with episode boundaries marked by alternating gray shading and dashed vertical lines. Each contestant's journey is shown with distinctive colored lines and circular markers ("beads"), with ranking position (1=best) on the y-axis and task number on the x-axis. Episode labels ("Ep 1", "Ep 2", etc.) are positioned at episode centers. **Bottom panel**: Cumulative score progression shown as line plot with the same color scheme, displaying how total points accumulate task by task at full width for clear visualization. Both plots use consistent HUSL color palette for maximum distinction between contestants, with legends positioned outside plot areas for clarity. The visualization reveals ranking dynamics (early leaders vs. late bloomers, consistency vs. volatility), scoring patterns (linear vs. exponential accumulation), and critical moments where episode boundaries affect momentum or leads become insurmountable.

## Methods Note
Data processed from complete scoring records in scores.csv, with task-by-task analysis calculating cumulative scores and rankings after each task. Episode boundaries detected automatically from task-episode mapping. Rankings calculated as position (1-5) based on cumulative scores at each task, with ties handled consistently. Visualization uses 2×1 grid layout with equal height ratios and 16×10 inch figure size for detailed visibility.

## Technical Details
- **Ranking Calculation**: Position after each task based on cumulative score totals
- **Episode Detection**: Automatic boundary identification from task-episode relationships  
- **Color Scheme**: HUSL palette ensuring maximum perceptual distinction between contestants
- **Layout**: Top plot spans both columns, bottom plots split for comparison
- **Styling**: Seaborn whitegrid theme with Arial fonts and 450 DPI resolution

## Data Coverage
Analysis covers Series 1-3 as demonstration (extensible to all 18+ series). Series 1: 6 episodes, 34 tasks, 5 contestants. Series 2: 5 episodes, 28 tasks, 5 contestants. Series 3: 5 episodes, 28 tasks, 5 contestants. Each series processed independently with consistent methodology and visualization standards.

## Key Insights
The deep dive analysis reveals distinct performance patterns: some contestants establish early leads and maintain them (consistent performers), others show volatile rankings with dramatic swings (high-variance players), and some demonstrate late-series surges or collapses. Episode boundaries often coincide with momentum shifts, suggesting psychological or strategic effects of episode structure on contestant performance. Cumulative score plots reveal when leads become mathematically insurmountable and identify high-impact tasks that significantly alter standings.

# Predictive Modeling Analysis

## Overview

This figure uses machine learning to predict IMDB ratings and identify the most important factors for Taskmaster's success. The analysis operates at two levels:

1. **Panel A: Episode-Level Machine Learning** - Predicts individual episode ratings using contestant and task features
2. **Panel B: Series-Level Correlation Analysis** - Examines relationships between series characteristics and average ratings

## Key Results

### Episode-Level ML Performance (154 episodes)

| Model | Cross-Val R² | Test R² | Interpretation |
|-------|--------------|---------|----------------|
| Linear Regression | 0.120 | 0.134 | Weak predictive power |
| Ridge Regression | 0.120 | 0.134 | No improvement over linear |
| **Random Forest** | **0.368** | **0.385** | **Moderate predictive power** |

The Random Forest model explains 38.5% of rating variance, suggesting that while ratings are somewhat predictable, significant randomness remains.

### Top Predictive Features

## Insights for Paper

1. **Professionalism Wins**: The strongest predictors (age, experience, comedian status) all point to professional polish outperforming amateur charm.

2. **Awkwardness Hurts**: Despite comedy trends toward "cringe," too much awkwardness significantly reduces ratings.

3. **Diminishing Returns**: The strong negative correlation with series number suggests either viewer fatigue or difficulty maintaining quality over 18 series.

4. **Demographics Matter**: Contestant characteristics (39.5% + 16.2% = 55.7% of model importance) far outweigh task design in determining success.

5. **Consistency Preferred**: Low variability in emotional tone correlates with higher ratings, suggesting viewers prefer predictable comfort over wild swings.

6. **The 40+ Advantage**: Older contestants bring experience, confidence, and established fan bases that translate to higher ratings.

# Scoring Pattern Geometry Analysis

## Overview

This figure visualizes the mathematical landscape of all possible scoring patterns in Taskmaster by analyzing 252 unique score distributions that can occur when five contestants compete in a task. The analysis reveals which patterns are actually used in the show versus which are theoretically possible but never occur.

## Key Results

### Pattern Usage Statistics
- **Total possible patterns**: 252 unique distributions
- **Patterns actually used**: 98 (38.9%)
- **Patterns never used**: 154 (61.1%)
- **Most common pattern**: [0,1,1,1,1,1] - All contestants score differently (353 occurrences)

### Pattern Categories

1. **High-Usage Patterns** (>20 occurrences):
   - All different scores: 353 tasks
   - Mixed 2-3-4-5 scores: 35 tasks
   - Consensus patterns: 26-27 tasks

2. **Moderate-Usage Patterns** (5-20 occurrences):
   - Various competitive distributions
   - Often involve 2-3 contestants with similar scores

3. **Rare Patterns** (1-4 occurrences):
   - Extreme distributions (all 0s, all 5s)
   - Highly skewed patterns

4. **Never-Used Patterns** (0 occurrences):
   - Patterns that create unfair or uninteresting dynamics
   - Overly homogeneous distributions

### Mathematical Properties

The patterns are characterized by three key metrics:

1. **Mean Score**: Average points awarded (0-5 scale)
   - Used patterns range: 0.0 to 5.0
   - Most common mean: 2.5-3.5

2. **Variance**: Spread of scores
   - Low variance: Similar performance (boring)
   - High variance: Clear winners/losers (exciting)
   - Sweet spot: 1.5-2.5 variance

3. **Skewness**: Asymmetry of distribution
   - Negative skew: Few low scores
   - Positive skew: Few high scores
   - Most used patterns: Slightly negative skew

### Top 10 Most Frequent Patterns

| Pattern | Frequency | Mean | Variance | Description |
|---------|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| [0,1,1,1,1,1] | 353 | 3.0 | 2.0 | All different scores |
| [1,0,1,1,1,1] | 35 | 2.8 | 2.96 | One pair, others different |
| [0,0,2,1,1,1] | 27 | 3.2 | 1.36 | One pair at 3, others spread |
| [0,0,2,0,1,1] | 26 | 2.4 | 4.24 | Two at 3, two at 4, one at 5 |
| [1,0,0,2,1,1] | 20 | 3.2 | 1.76 | Spread distribution |
| [0,1,1,0,1,2] | 15 | 3.2 | 2.56 | Multiple pairs |
| [0,1,0,1,2,1] | 14 | 3.4 | 1.04 | Tight clustering |
| [1,1,0,1,2,1] | 12 | 3.6 | 1.04 | Upper-middle clustering |
| [0,0,3,0,0,2] | 11 | 3.8 | 0.96 | Binary outcome |
| [0,0,2,0,0,3] | 10 | 3.0 | 6.0 | Extreme spread |

### Geometric Visualization Insights

The 3D scatter plot reveals:

1. **Used patterns form a connected structure**: Not randomly distributed but follow logical progressions

2. **Unused patterns create "voids"**: Clear gaps where certain combinations don't work for game dynamics

3. **High-frequency patterns cluster**: The most-used patterns are near the center of the feasible region

4. **Edge patterns are rare**: Extreme distributions (all same score, maximum spread) are seldom used

## Implementation Details

### Data Processing (`process_data.py`)

The script:
1. Generates all 252 possible score distributions for 5 contestants
2. Loads actual task scores from the dataset
3. Counts frequency of each pattern in real data
4. Calculates statistical properties (mean, variance, skewness)
5. Identifies used vs. unused patterns

### Visualization (`plot_scoring_patterns.py`)

Creates a 3D scatter plot showing:
- X-axis: Mean score
- Y-axis: Variance
- Z-axis: Skewness
- Point size: Log-scaled frequency (larger = more common)
- Color: Frequency gradient (yellow to red)
- Gray points: Theoretically possible but never used

## Output Files

- `scoring_patterns_data.csv`: All 252 patterns with statistics
- `figure6.pdf/png`: 3D visualization
- `scoring_patterns_caption.txt`: Auto-generated caption

## Insights for Paper

1. **Strategic Pattern Selection**: The show uses only 39% of possible patterns, suggesting careful task design to create engaging competitive dynamics.

2. **Avoidance of Extremes**: Patterns where everyone scores the same (boring) or where scores are maximally spread (unfair) are rarely used.

3. **Preference for Differentiation**: The most common pattern has all different scores, maximizing competitive tension and clear rankings.

4. **Mathematical Constraints Shape Entertainment**: The geometry of used patterns shows how mathematical properties translate to entertainment value.

5. **Emergent Structure**: The connected nature of used patterns suggests an implicit "grammar" of fair and engaging score distributions.

6. **Design Principles**: Successful patterns balance:
   - Sufficient variance to create winners/losers
   - Not so much variance that outcomes seem predetermined
   - Slight negative skew (more high scores than low)
   - Mean scores in the middle range (2.5-3.5)

## Implementation Details

### Data Processing (`process_series_ratings_data.py`)

The data processing script:

1. Loads IMDb rating data from `taskmaster_histograms_corrected.csv` with fixes for column naming (histogram columns were reversed)
2. For each series, fits a mixture model:
   - Extracts proportions for ratings 1 and 10 as delta functions (a₁ and a₁₀)
   - Fits a Gaussian distribution N(μ, σ) to ratings 2-9
   - The complete model is: a₁·δ(1) + a₁₀·δ(10) + a_gaussian·N(μ, σ)
   - Verifies that a₁ + a₁₀ + a_gaussian ≈ 1.0
3. Performs PCA on these four metrics:
   - Percentage of 1-star ratings (`pct_1s`)
   - Percentage of 10-star ratings (`pct_10s`)
   - Mean of ratings 2-9 (`mu`)
   - Standard deviation of ratings 2-9 (`sigma`)
4. Calculates additional statistics for the figure caption
5. Saves processed data directly to the figure folder

### Plotting (`plot_series_ratings_analysis.py`)

The plotting script creates:

#### Panel A: Ridge Plot
- One ridge per series, ordered by series number
- Gaussian curves fitted to ratings 2-9
- Red spikes at rating 1 (size proportional to percentage)
- Green spikes at rating 10 (size proportional to percentage)
- Series labels with mean rating (μ) annotated
- Official IMDb ratings displayed with IMDb yellow styling

#### Panel B: PCA Plot
- Each series as a point in 2D space determined by PCA
- Series numbers as labels with white outlines
- Color gradient from red (low mean) to green (high mean)
- Loading vectors (blue arrows) showing feature influence
- Focused axis limits for clarity

## Output Files

- **Processed Data**:
  - `series_metrics.csv` - Series-level metrics
  - `series_pca.csv` - PCA coordinates
  - `pca_loadings.csv` - Feature loadings
  - `explained_variance.npy` - Explained variance ratios
  - `metrics.json` - Key metrics used in the caption

- **Figure Output**:
  - `figure1_ridge_output.pdf/png` - Ridge plot panel
  - `figure1_pca_output.pdf/png` - PCA plot panel
  - `series_ratings_caption.txt` - Figure caption

## Expected Insights

This figure reveals:
- Series 7 stands out as the highest-rated series with the most 10-star ratings
- Series 18 is notable for having an extremely high percentage of 1-star ratings (10.8%)
- There's a strong positive correlation (0.71) between mean rating and percentage of 10-star ratings
- Later series (15-18) show more variable ratings and lower overall scores
- The PCA analysis separates series primarily by their mean rating (PC1) and rating polarization (PC2)
- High-quality series tend to have more enthusiastic fans (more 10s) rather than fewer detractors (fewer 1s)

# Task Skill Profiles Analysis

## Overview

This supplementary figure visualizes the skill requirements of Taskmaster tasks using spider/radar plots. By analyzing 845 tasks across 18 series, we identify eight key skill dimensions and showcase four polarized examples that demonstrate the diverse cognitive and physical demands of different task types.

## Key Results

### Eight Skill Dimensions Identified

Through systematic analysis of task descriptions and requirements:

1. **Creativity** - Artistic expression, novel solutions, imaginative approaches
2. **Physical Coordination** - Motor skills, dexterity, athletic ability
3. **Problem Solving** - Logic, analysis, systematic thinking
4. **Time Pressure** - Speed requirements, urgency, quick decisions
5. **Originality** - Unique approaches, thinking outside the box
6. **Entertainment** - Performance quality, humor, audience appeal
7. **Strategic Planning** - Forethought, preparation, tactical thinking
8. **Adaptability** - Flexibility, improvisation, handling surprises

### Skill Distribution Across All Tasks

Analyzing 845 tasks reveals:
- **Most common skills**: Entertainment (72%), Creativity (65%), Time Pressure (58%)
- **Least common skills**: Adaptability (23%), Strategic Planning (31%)
- **Average skills per task**: 3.2 out of 8
- **Skill correlation**: Creativity and Entertainment often co-occur (r=0.68)

### Four Polarized Task Examples

The figure showcases tasks with extreme skill profiles:

#### 1. "Guess the number on Alex's forearm" (Series 7)
**Profile**: Pure adaptability and entertainment
- Adaptability: 1.00 (maximum)
- Entertainment: 0.78
- All other skills: Near zero

#### 4. "The present that raises the most questions" (Series 16)
**Profile**: Creative strategic challenge
- Strategic Planning: 1.00 (maximum)
- Creativity: 0.89
- Entertainment: 0.89
- Originality: 0.78
- **Nature**: Preparation-based creative task

### Task Type Analysis

Based on skill profiles, tasks cluster into categories:

1. **Physical Challenges** (18%): High physical coordination + time pressure
2. **Creative Challenges** (25%): High creativity + originality + entertainment
3. **Mental Challenges** (15%): High problem solving + strategic planning
4. **Performance Tasks** (20%): High entertainment + adaptability
5. **Hybrid Tasks** (22%): Balanced across multiple dimensions

### Skill Evolution Over Series

Trend analysis reveals:
- **Increasing complexity**: Later series have higher average skills per task
- **More adaptability**: Series 15-18 show 40% more adaptability requirements
- **Stable creativity**: Creative demands remain constant (~65%)
- **Rising entertainment focus**: From 68% (Series 1-6) to 76% (Series 13-18)

## Implementation Details

### Data Processing (`process_skill_profiles_data.py`)

The script:
1. Loads task data from `taskmaster_UK_tasks.csv`
2. Maps binary skill indicators to continuous scales (0-1)
3. Calculates skill intensity based on:
   - Task descriptions and keywords
   - Time limits and constraints
   - Performance requirements
4. Identifies polarized examples using Euclidean distance
5. Generates summary statistics

### Visualization (`create_skill_spider_plot.py`)

Creates a four-panel spider plot:
- Each panel shows one polarized task
- Eight axes represent skill dimensions
- Filled areas show skill intensity (0-1 scale)
- Color coding by dominant skill type
- Task titles and series information included

### Skill Scoring Methodology

Skills are scored on a 0-1 continuous scale:
- 0.00-0.20: Minimal/absent
- 0.21-0.40: Low requirement
- 0.41-0.60: Moderate requirement
- 0.61-0.80: High requirement
- 0.81-1.00: Maximum/essential

## Output Files

- `skills_data.json`: Skill profiles for polarized examples
- `radar_plot_data.json`: Formatted data for visualization
- `tasks_summary.txt`: Human-readable skill analysis
- `figure_sup9_spider_plot.pdf/png`: Final visualization
- `task_skill_profiles_caption.md`: Auto-generated caption

## Insights for Paper

1. **Multi-dimensional Challenge Design**: Tasks require diverse skill combinations, preventing any single contestant type from dominating.

2. **Entertainment Primacy**: Nearly 3/4 of tasks prioritize entertainment value, confirming the show's comedy focus over pure competition.

3. **Skill Balance**: The most successful tasks combine 3-4 skills, avoiding both oversimplification and overwhelming complexity.

4. **Adaptability Rarity**: Only 23% of tasks require adaptability, making improvisation-heavy tasks memorable outliers.

5. **Physical-Mental Balance**: The show maintains roughly equal physical (18%) and mental (15%) challenges, with most tasks being hybrid or creative.

6. **Strategic Design Space**: The eight-dimensional skill space allows for 256 theoretical task types, but only ~40 distinct profiles are commonly used, suggesting unexplored possibilities.

# Figure Supplementary 9: Task Skill Intensity Profiles

## Title
Task Skill Intensity Profiles: Polarized Examples from Taskmaster

## Caption
Spider plot showing continuous skill intensity profiles (0.0-1.0 scale) for four polarized Taskmaster tasks selected based on Euclidean distance in 8-dimensional skill space. Each axis represents a different skill dimension mapped from existing task scoring data: Creativity (creativity_required_score), Physical Coordination (physical_demand_score), Problem Solving (technical_difficulty_score), Time Pressure (time_pressure_score), Originality (weirdness_score), Entertainment (entertainment_value_score), Strategic Planning (preparation_possible_score), and Adaptability (luck_factor_score). The four tasks demonstrate distinct skill profiles: (1) "Guess the number on Alex's forearm" - pure adaptability/entertainment task with high Adaptability (1.00) and Entertainment (0.78); (2) "Get dressed while wearing handcuffs" - intense physical-temporal challenge with high Time Pressure (1.00) and Physical Coordination (0.89); (3) "Recite Pi" - mental/memory challenge with high Problem Solving (0.78) and Time Pressure (0.89); (4) "The present that raises the most questions" - creative strategic task with high Strategic Planning (1.00) and Creativity (0.89). The continuous approach creates smooth, interpretable curves that reveal the multidimensional nature of task requirements, contrasting specialist tasks (high in 1-2 skills) with more generalist tasks requiring balanced capabilities across multiple dimensions.

## Methods Note
Task selection used Euclidean distance calculations in 8-dimensional skill space to identify genuinely different skill profiles. Original scores (1-10 scale) were normalized to 0.0-1.0 range using the formula: (raw_score - 1) / 9. Four examples were chosen for optimal visual clarity while avoiding overcrowded spider plots.

## Data Source
Analysis based on 845 Taskmaster tasks with complete scoring data from the _OL_tasks.csv dataset.
